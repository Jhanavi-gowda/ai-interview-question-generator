# ai-interview-question-generator
Developed a web app that generates technical interview questions dynamically based on user-selected topics (e.g., JavaScript, SQL). Built with React and OpenAIâ€™s GPT API for real-time, customized question display. Planned upgrades include Node.js and MongoDB for storing data and enabling AI-based mock interviews.
